## 1. Drawings
For drawings (e.g. in readme-files), we recomment to use the program [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). It is open source software and runs on Linux, Mac and Windows. If you want to draw electirc circuits, we recommend this library on [github](https://github.com/upb-lea/Inkscape_electric_Symbols).

## 2. Write Code

### 2.1 Use docstrings
Documentation is generated by Sphinx, and Sphinx reads the docstrings inside the code. Make sure to keep the docstrings up-to-date when making a change!

## 3. generate pip package

### 3.1 generate requirements.txt
File 'requirements.txt' is auto generated by pipreqs. To install pipreqs, do the following
```
pip install pipreqs
```
Generate the 'requirements.txt'-file
```
pipreqs /home/project/location/transistor_database
```
Further information can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/)

### 3.2 Generate pip-package by using setup.py
Some useful links
 * [classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/)
Run setup.py as the following from your operating system command line
```
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel 
```
Please find the generated pip package inside the /dist-folder

### 3.3 Test the pip package from local installation before uploading 
```
python3 -m pip install transistordatabase-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl  
```

### 3.4 Upload pip package to pypi
Run this from your operating system command line
```
twine upload --repository pypi dist/* 
```

### 3.5 Hint
Note: 2.2 and 2.3 can also be done by installing the package direct from the source code into python. You need to reinstall it after any change in the source-code if you want to work with the latest version.
```
cd /path/of/python/package
python3 -m pip install -e .
```
