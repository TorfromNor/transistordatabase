# Transistor_Database (TDB)
Import/export and manage transistor data in the transistor database.

Functionality examples
 * digitize transistor datasheet parameters and graphs and save it to the TDB
 * use this data for calculations in python (e.g. some loss calulations for a boost-converter)
 * export this data to matlab for calculations in matlab
 


## Installation
```
cd /Documents/Folder/of/Interest   
git clone git@github.com:upb-lea/Transistor_Database.git
```


## Usage


## Roadmap
Planned features in 2021
* show a virtual datasheet of a transistor
* exporters to a few programs, e.g. Simulink, GeckoCIRCUITS, PLECs, ...
* save measurement data from double pulse measurements in the transistor database
* compare resistors within the database (e.g. compare measurements wit datasheet values, or compare datasheet values for transistor A with transistor B)


## Bug Reports
Please use the issues report button within github to report bugs.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
     
For drawings (e.g. in readme-files), we recomment to use the program [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). It is open source software and runs on Linux, Mac and Windows. If you want to draw electirc circuits, we recommend this library on [github](https://github.com/upb-lea/Inkscape_electric_Symbols).

## History and project status
This project started in 2020 as a side project and was initially written in matlab. It quickly became clear that the project was no longer a side project. The project should be completely rewritten, because many new complex levels have been added. To place the project in the open source world, the programming language python is used.      
     
In january 2020 a very early alpha status is reached.
