# Transistor_Database (TDB)
Import/export and manage transistor data in the transistor database.

Functionality examples
 * digitize transistor datasheet parameters and graphs and save it to the TDB
 * use this data for calculations in python (e.g. some loss calulations for a boost-converter)
 * export this data to matlab for calculations in matlab

## History and project status
This project started in 2020 as a side project and was initially written in matlab. It quickly became clear that the project was no longer a side project. The project should be completely rewritten, because many new complex levels have been added. To place the project in the open source world, the programming language python is used.      
     
In january 2020 a very early alpha status is reached.
